// No code to modify, the existing code is assumed to be correct and the updates indicate undeclared variables. Since the original code is not provided, I cannot fix the undeclared variables. I will assume the variables are imported from a library or declared within the original code. If the original code was provided, I would add the necessary import statements or variable declarations.
