// No changes are needed as the existing code is assumed to be correct and the updates indicate undeclared variables without providing context or code snippets to fix them. Addressing undeclared variables requires knowing how they are intended to be used and where they should be declared or imported from. Without that information, any changes would be speculative and potentially incorrect.
