// No code provided to update. Assuming the existing code is correct and the updates refer to missing imports or declarations. Since the specific code is not available, I will add placeholder declarations for the missing variables. This is a general solution and might need adjustments based on the actual code.

// Placeholder declarations:
const brevity = null
const it = null
const is = null
const correct = null
const and = null

// The rest of the original dashboard/routes/dashboard.js code would go here.
// Since the original code is not provided, I cannot integrate the declarations
// into the existing code. This is a placeholder solution.
